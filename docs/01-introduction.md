# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome!

In this Labspace, you're going to gain familiarity with Docker and many of its core components. Specifically, you'll get to do the following:

- Learn about the role of containers and images
- Run containers and build images
- Learn about Docker's tooling, including Docker Compose, Testcontainers, and Scout
- Have fun along the way!

### What's _not_ in this overview?

The new AI-focused aspects of Docker's tooling will not be covered in this overview. That will be covered in another Labspace.



## ðŸ’» The Memes-R-Us website

For the remainder of this lab, you are a member of the Memes-R-Us development team. Congrats! ðŸŽ‰

The Memes-R-Us app is a simple website that displays memes and a welcome message.

## Your task

Your task is fairly simple - update the website with a new message and containerize the app.

But, in order to make this update and verify it works, you'll need to complete the following tasks:

1. Setup your development environment to run the app
2. Make the update to site.
3. Containerize the app and prepare it for deployment

Don't worry! You'll have help all along the way. Let's get to it!
